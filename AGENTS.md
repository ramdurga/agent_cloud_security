# ü§ñ Agentic AI Security System - Agent Architecture

## Overview

This security monitoring system implements an **agentic architecture** where autonomous agents work together to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real-time. Each agent has specific responsibilities and can make independent decisions based on their observations.

## üéØ Core Agents

### 1. AnomalyDetectionAgent
**Location:** `src/agents/anomaly_detector.py`

**Purpose:** The primary security analysis agent that autonomously detects anomalies in network and user behavior data.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Self-learning baseline:** Maintains and updates statistical baselines autonomously
- **Multi-modal detection:** Processes both network and behavioral events
- **Confidence scoring:** Self-assesses detection reliability
- **False positive estimation:** Predicts likelihood of incorrect detections

**Configuration:**
```python
# Initialize the agent
agent = AnomalyDetectionAgent()

# Default configuration
- contamination: 0.05          # Expected anomaly rate
- detection_threshold: 0.7     # Minimum score to flag as anomaly
- n_estimators: 100            # Isolation Forest trees
```

**Agent Decision Process:**
1. Extract features from incoming events
2. Calculate anomaly score using statistical analysis
3. Apply pattern matching for known threats
4. Self-assess confidence in detection
5. Estimate false positive probability
6. Classify threat level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
7. Generate actionable recommendations

**Autonomous Features:**
- Updates baselines in real-time without human intervention
- Adjusts detection sensitivity based on historical accuracy
- Learns from event patterns to improve future detections

### 2. RealTimeProcessor (Orchestrator Agent)
**Location:** `src/pipeline/real_time_processor.py`

**Purpose:** Orchestrates the flow of events and coordinates between agents while managing real-time processing.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Event buffering:** Manages high-volume event streams
- **Batch processing:** Optimizes performance through batching
- **Event correlation:** Links related events across time windows
- **False positive reduction:** Secondary filtering layer

**Configuration:**
```python
# Initialize the processor
processor = RealTimeProcessor(
    buffer_size=1000,      # Event buffer capacity
    batch_size=50,         # Events per batch
)

# Internal settings
- correlation_window: 5 minutes
- max_buffer_size: 1000 events
```

**Agent Behaviors:**
1. **Autonomous Correlation:** Groups events from same entities within 5-minute windows
2. **Confidence Adjustment:** Modifies confidence based on time-of-day patterns
3. **Adaptive Filtering:** Removes low-confidence detections automatically
4. **Performance Optimization:** Self-adjusts batch sizes based on load

**Decision Rules:**
- Correlates events with same affected entities
- Reduces confidence for repeated similar patterns (noise reduction)
- Filters detections with confidence < 40% and threat level "low"
- Boosts confidence for events during unusual hours (2-6 AM)

### 3. DataGenerator (Simulation Agent)
**Location:** `src/utils/data_generator.py`

**Purpose:** Generates realistic security events for testing and training the system.

**Capabilities:**
- Simulates normal network traffic
- Creates suspicious behavior patterns
- Generates attack scenarios (data exfiltration, brute force)

## üß† Agent Intelligence Features

### 1. Statistical Learning
- **Baseline Evolution:** Agents continuously update their understanding of "normal"
- **Z-score Analysis:** Statistical deviation detection
- **Moving Averages:** Adaptive thresholds based on recent history

### 2. Pattern Recognition
```python
# Network attack patterns
- Data exfiltration: Large outbound transfers to suspicious IPs
- Port scanning: Rapid connections to multiple ports
- Lateral movement: Unusual internal network traversal

# Behavioral patterns
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Off-hours access
- Sensitive resource access from unusual locations
```

### 3. Confidence Scoring Algorithm
```python
def calculate_confidence_score(anomaly_score, event_count):
    base_confidence = anomaly_score * 0.7
    sample_size_factor = min(1.0, event_count / 100.0)
    confidence = base_confidence + (sample_size_factor * 0.3)
    
    # Adjust based on false positive history
    if recent_fp_rate > 0:
        confidence *= (1 - recent_fp_rate * 0.5)
    
    return min(confidence, 0.99)
```

### 4. False Positive Reduction Strategy
- **Correlation Window:** 5-minute grouping of related events
- **Similarity Filtering:** Removes duplicate patterns
- **Context Awareness:** Time-based and location-based adjustments
- **Historical Learning:** Tracks and learns from past false positives

## ‚öôÔ∏è Agent Configuration Examples

### Basic Setup
```python
from src.agents.anomaly_detector import AnomalyDetectionAgent
from src.pipeline.real_time_processor import RealTimeProcessor

# Create agents
detector = AnomalyDetectionAgent()
processor = RealTimeProcessor(buffer_size=1000, batch_size=25)

# Adjust detection sensitivity
detector.detection_threshold = 0.6  # More sensitive

# Start processing
await processor.run()
```

### Custom Agent Configuration
```python
# Configure for high-security environment
detector.detection_threshold = 0.5  # Lower threshold
detector.isolation_forest.contamination = 0.01  # Expect fewer anomalies

# Configure for noisy environment
processor.correlation_window = timedelta(minutes=10)  # Longer correlation
detector.detection_threshold = 0.8  # Higher threshold
```

## üîß Extending the Agent System

### Adding New Detection Patterns
```python
# In AnomalyDetectionAgent
def detect_custom_pattern(self, event):
    if event.bytes_sent > threshold and event.destination in watchlist:
        return True, 0.9, "Custom pattern detected"
    return False, 0.0, ""
```

### Creating New Agent Types
```python
class ThreatIntelligenceAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.threat_feeds = []
        self.reputation_db = {}
    
    def check_reputation(self, ip_address):
        # Check against threat intelligence feeds
        return self.reputation_db.get(ip_address, 0.5)
```

### Agent Communication Protocol
```python
# Agents communicate through event objects
detection = await anomaly_agent.process_event(event)
enriched = await threat_intel_agent.enrich(detection)
final = await response_agent.determine_action(enriched)
```

## üéØ Agent Decision Examples

### Example 1: Data Exfiltration Detection
```
Event: Large data transfer (50MB) to IP 185.220.101.45
Agent Analysis:
- Anomaly Score: 0.85 (suspicious IP + large transfer)
- Confidence: 78% (high confidence due to multiple indicators)
- Threat Level: HIGH
- Actions: Block IP, investigate user, preserve logs
```

### Example 2: False Positive Reduction
```
Event: Multiple similar login failures
Agent Analysis:
- Initial Detection: 5 anomalies
- Correlation: All from same user within 2 minutes
- Decision: Reduce to 1 anomaly (likely single incident)
- FP Reduction: 80% reduction in alerts
```

### Example 3: Adaptive Learning
```
Pattern: Regular 2 AM backup causing alerts
Agent Learning:
- Week 1: High anomaly scores (0.8+)
- Week 2: Baseline updated, scores reducing (0.6)
- Week 3: Pattern recognized as normal (0.3)
- Result: No more false alerts for scheduled backups
```

## üîç Monitoring Agent Health

### Health Check Commands
```python
# Get agent statistics
stats = processor.get_stats()
print(f"Events Processed: {stats['events_processed']}")
print(f"Detection Rate: {stats['anomalies_detected']}")
print(f"FP Reduction: {stats['false_positives_reduced']}")

# Check agent state
if processor.is_running:
    print("Processor agent is active")
    
# View agent configuration
print(f"Threshold: {detector.detection_threshold}")
print(f"Buffer Size: {processor.buffer_size}")
```

## üìö Agent Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative:** Begin with higher thresholds and adjust down
2. **Monitor False Positives:** Track and tune based on FP rates
3. **Regular Baseline Updates:** Allow agents to learn patterns over time
4. **Correlation Windows:** Adjust based on your environment's event velocity
5. **Resource Monitoring:** Watch agent memory and CPU usage
6. **Incremental Learning:** Let agents adapt gradually to new patterns

## üÜò Troubleshooting Agents

### High False Positive Rate
- Increase `detection_threshold` (e.g., 0.7 ‚Üí 0.8)
- Extend `correlation_window` (e.g., 5 ‚Üí 10 minutes)
- Review baseline statistics for accuracy

### Missing Real Threats
- Decrease `detection_threshold` (e.g., 0.7 ‚Üí 0.6)
- Add specific pattern detection rules
- Check if baselines are too broad

### Performance Issues
- Reduce `batch_size` for lower latency
- Increase `buffer_size` for burst handling
- Consider running agents on separate threads/processes
